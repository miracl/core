# Description

Several helper programs are provided to assist with the addition of
new elliptic curves. Note that these programs will not be needed if using
one of the supported curves. These programs must be built using the MIRACL
library. See source code for compilation instructions

    bigtobig.cpp -- converts to BIG number format

    check.cpp -- checks for optimal choice of number base

    bestpair.cpp -- finds best BN, BLS12, BLS24 and BLS48 pairing-friendly curves

    romgen.cpp -- rough-and-ready program used to help generate ROM files for all of the different languages.
