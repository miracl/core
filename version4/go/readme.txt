Namespaces are used to separate different curves.

So for example to support both ED25519 and the NIST P256 curves, one
could import into a particular module both "core/ED25519" and "core/NIST256"

Separate ROM files provide the constants required for each curve. Some
files (BIG.go, FP.go, ECP.go) also specify certain constants 
that must be set for the particular curve.

--------------------------------------

Make sure that the GOPATH environmental variable is set.

Then clone the MIRACL Core repository by executing

go get github.com/miracl/core

Ignore the warning message about "no Go files"

This assumes that Git is installed on your machine - see 
https://git-scm.com/download/

Next navigate to $GOPATH/src/github.com/miracl/core/version4/go

NOTE: If the repository address changes, then change the above, and also
change import statements at the start of some files.

To build the library and see it in action, execute the python3 
script config32.py or config64.py (depending om whether you want a 
32 or 64-bit build), and select the curves that you wish to support. 

As a quick example execute

py config64.py

or

python3 config64.py

Then select options 1, 3, 7, 19, 21, 27, 28 and 30 (these are fixed for the example 
program provided). Select 0 to exit.

Run the test program by executing

go run TestALL.go

The correct PIN is 1234

Run another test program by executing

go run TestBLS.go

Next run the Benchmark program by executing

go run BenchtestALL.go

Finally

go run TestNHS.go
