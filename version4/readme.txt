Several helper programs are provided to assist with the addition of
new elliptic curves. Note that these programs will not be needed if using
one of the supported curves. These programs must be build using the MIRACL
library. See source code for compilation instructions

bigtobig.cpp - converts to BIG number format

check.cpp - checks for optimal choice of number base

bestpair.cpp - finds best BN, BLS12 and BLS24 pairing-friendly curves
(Note - the library does not currently support BLS24 curves)

romgen.cpp - rough-and-ready program used to help generate ROM files for
all of the different languages.
